				<em><p>Firstly, thanks for visiting my online resume. It may not be very glossy or flashy, but I can proudly say it is something I built on my own. I was constantly wondering how do I make my resume look better. After all, the famous theory goes that recruiters rarely look at your resume for more than six seconds. So how do I make mine stand out? How do I make mine different. The last thing I want is presenting myself in a completely different manner. So this is when I thought why not simple put your resume as a complete web-page. The idea worked out pretty well and thanks to this endeavour of mine, I ended up learning HTML and CSS!<br></p>
				<p>Kindly go through the categories as per your requirement and however and whatever you want to know about me. To know me more as a person, kindly check the About Me page. If you feel that I visiting this page was worth your time and I can contribute in any way to your organization, kindly Contact Me. Thanks!</p>
