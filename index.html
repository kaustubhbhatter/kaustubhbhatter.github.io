			<div id="Basic_Intro"><em><p>Firstly, thanks for visiting my online resume. It may not be very glossy or flashy, but I can at least say that it is something that I built on my own. I was constantly wondering how do I make my resume look better. After all, the famous theory goes that recruiters rarely look at your resume for more than six seconds. So how do I make mine stand out? How do I make mine different? Doing so is not easy as it sounds as you mostly end up presenting yourself in a pretentious manner. It was then that I thought, why not bring my resume to the internet! So this is when I thought of putting my resume as a complete web-page. The idea worked out pretty well and thanks to this endeavour, I ended up learning HTML and CSS!<br><br>
				You click can click on the links above to navigate to the respective page which might help you know some additional things about me that may not be present here, or a few similar things presented in a different manner.<br><br>
				Kindly go through the categories above as per your requirement to know more about me.
