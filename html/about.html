	<p>I am the face of every other Indian you will see. I am a simple boy from a middle class family, aspiring to live the great Indian dream. One that dreams of being in the clouds, not shying away from the bolts of lightning that shall come; and this is because I know there are no short-cuts in this world.</p>
<p>I take pride in working hard for things. After all, if I don't work hard, I might have it, but I definitely would not have earned it.</p>
		<p>Having said that, I personally believe that I am extremely adaptable. This is not restricted in terms of different kinds of situations, but also different kinds of people. No one is perfect. No scenario is perfect. We will never really be able to evaluate something unless we look at it from an unbiased viewpoint, right?</p>
		<p>I can always go on to say that I am deadline-driven, hard working, passionate about what I do and so on. But you never know what situation suits and what doesn't. What I do know is I tend not to give up very easily. I try to push myself a bit more and of course I know how to accept defeat with my head held high.</p></em>
