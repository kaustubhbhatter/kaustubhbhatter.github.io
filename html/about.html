		I am a boy from a simple middle class family, aspiring to make it big in the world. I know that there are no short-cuts in this world. In fact, being passionate about coding and yet completing my major in a slightly different field, makes me flexible but yet poses to be extremely challenging. But I definitely know that if you have not worked hard for something, you may have it but you haven't really earned it.
		<p>Having said all of that, I personally believe that I am extremely adaptable. This is not restricted in terms of different kinds of situations, but also different kinds of people. No one is perfect. No scenario is perfect. We will never really be able to evaluate something unless we look at it from an unbiased viewpoint, right?</p></em>
