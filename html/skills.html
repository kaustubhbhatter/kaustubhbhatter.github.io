		Skills are said to be developed over time and I could not agree more. But none the less, I have had a challenging way of developing my skillset. As far as my core stream is concerned, I was extremely selective when it came to learning beyond the scope of the syllabus. I was particularly interested in microcontrollers and thus IoT based projects. This was probably due to the fact that I love coding, which is  reflected by my project roles and skill set.<p class="inner_header"><strong>PROGRAMMING SKILLS</strong></p><p class="inner_content">JAVA<br>PYTHON<br>HTML<br>CSS<br>SQL</p><p class="inner_header"><strong>SOFTWARES USED</strong></p><p class="inner_content">ARDUINO<br>ANDROID STUDIO<br>MATLAB<br>PREZI</p><p class="inner_header"><strong>LANGUAGES KNOWN</strong></p><p class="inner_content">ENGLISH<br>HINDI<br>BENGALI<br>FRENCH</p></em>
