		Skills are said to be developed over time and I could not agree more. But none the less, I have had a challenging way of developing my skillset. As far as my core stream is concerned, I was particularly interested in microcontrollers and thus IoT based projects. This was probably due to the fact that I love coding. But this was not very easy as my major didn't involve too much of programming.<br>
		<p> Having said that, I tried to work with some project or the other and incorporate a part of my skill set into it. Sometimes I would succeed, sometimes I would not. But the thing is that I did not stop learning new things, which allows me to confidently say, if the skills listed below are not enough, I can learn more!</p><br>
