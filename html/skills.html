		Skills are said to be developed over time and I could not agree more. But none the less, I have had a challenging way of developing my skillset. As far as my core stream is concerned, I was extremely selective when it came to learning beyond the scope of the syllabus. I was particularly interested in microcontrollers and thus IoT based projects. This was probably due to the fact that I love coding, which is  reflected by my project roles and skill set.</em>
