		Words can define a lot but work is what tells the most as to what a person truely is capable of. I have been lucky to invest my time on working on projects in my major - electronics, and at the same time follow my passion of coding. Obviously I had multiple projects across my semesters wherein I had been working on some subject or the other. But then again I was bound by my subject as well as my knowledge. But there were some projects wherein I was able to work on goals that had a far more challenging and fullfilling experience.<p class="inner_header"><strong>NANOPARTICLES BASED WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM</strong></p><p class="inner_content">Via automated particle dispersion and recovery, nanoparticles having electromagnetic properties were used to remove impurities using synchronous stepper motors.</p><p class="inner_header"><strong>SYSTEM FOR ADVANCED LOCKING AND TICKETING</strong></p><p class="inner_content">SALT proposed a train seat locking system with real-time monitoring of the seat status. It ensures authentic seat occupancy and in-motion seat booking opportunities. An app was also developed to monitor the active seat status.</p><p class="inner_header"><strong>DENSITY BASED TRAFFIC MONITORING SYSTEM</strong></p><p class="inner_content">Created an active traffic density monitoring setup to develop automatic traffic-light switching algorithms.</p></em>
