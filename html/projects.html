		Words can define a lot but work is what tells the most as to what a person truely is capable of. I have been lucky to invest my time on working on projects in my major - electronics, and at the same time follow my passion of coding. Obviously I had multiple projects across my semesters wherein I had been working on some subject or the other. But then again I was bound by my subject as well as my knowledge. But there were some projects wherein I was able to work on goals that had a far more challenging and fullfilling experience.</em>
