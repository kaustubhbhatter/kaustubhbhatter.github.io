		Words can define a lot but work is what tells the most as to what a person truely is capable of. I have been lucky to invest my time on working on projects in my major - electronics, and at the same time follow my passion of coding. Obviously I had multiple projects across my semesters wherein I had been working on some subject or the other. But then again I was bound by my subject as well as my knowledge. But there were some projects wherein I was able to work on goals that had a far more challenging and fullfilling experience.<br><br>
		<p class="inner_header"><h3><strong>NANOPARTICLES BASED WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM</strong></h3></p><p class="inner_content">The project was one of a kind, self-initiated project between me and some of my colleagues from the Mechanical and the Bio-Technology department. We intended to use nanoparticles to purify water. Via automated particle dispersion and recovery, nanoparticles having electromagnetic properties were used to remove impurities using synchronous stepper motors. Further, a system was also proposed in order to recover the nanoparticles after separating the impure water from the main system.</p><br><p class="inner_header"><h3><strong>SYSTEM FOR ADVANCED LOCKING AND TICKETING</strong></h3></p><p class="inner_content">The system, which I refer to as SALT proposed a train seat locking system with real-time monitoring of the seat status. The project was a one that we had thought of previously but made it successfully, as a prototype, to demonstrate its utility during our final yearp project. We targetted the major issues that affect us during train travel - Corruption, Hassle and Digitalization. SALT ensures authentic seat occupancy and in-motion seat booking opportunities which is absent in the current system. An app was also developed to monitor the active seat status.</p><br><p class="inner_header"><h3><strong>DENSITY BASED TRAFFIC MONITORING SYSTEM</strong></h3></p><p class="inner_content">The project was similar to the systems present in several European nations and a few other countries aross the globe. The idea is to switch traffic lights at interesections according to the density at different lanes to ensure maximum effeciency and minimal traffic. LDR was also used to alter traffic light intensity on the basis of the time of the day</p></em><br>
