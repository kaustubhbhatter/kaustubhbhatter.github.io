		I am a fresh undergraduate right now and in the three internships of mine, I have realized one thing: Knowledge is a never ending process. You don't really know when you know something that might change your life altogether. But nonetheless, my experiences keep on pushing me to do things better and better. I am quite sure that I have a lot to learn in a lot of jobs out there.
