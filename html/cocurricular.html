		Yes, we have all heard that all work and no play makes Kaustubh a dull boy. I know Kaustubh pretty well and while he passionately loves developing and planning something creative every now and then, he does like to do stress busting things that make him happy and provide a change of environment. Luckily for me, my mother always encouraged me to do more and I didn't realize when this became a habit. Know more about the non-technical side of me to see if I am a cultural fit at your organization</em>
