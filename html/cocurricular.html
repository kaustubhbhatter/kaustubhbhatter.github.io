		I will just be honest. I hate sitting around and doing nothing. I love being involved in something or the other every now and then.<br>
I am the person who doesn't rely on his arsenal to be confined by a domain. I am the person who can fit into every crowd and yet always stand out.<br>
So here is the fun-side of me!<br><br>

<p class="inner_content">
	Debating - National Level Champion<br>I have been really fortunate enough to be a part of some wonderful debating events. The gold star, I believe would belong to the BITM Debate, organized by the Birla Museum. I had previously won debates at other schools, different fests, at Kala Mandir, at even a Hindustan Lever Speech Competition. But BITM was special. I came first in the entire Eastern Zone and received an award from Amit Mishra, the Finance Minister of West Bengal at the time!<br><br>
	Basketball - State Level Champion<br>Our school and an amazing history when it came to basketball and we had a daunting task ahead of us. As a point guard in the team, we had won the Bosco Challenge Shield, defeating various schools all over the city.<br><br>
	Dramatics - State Level Champion<br>The act can stop, but the actor cannot! At a competition organized by Hindustan Lever, we had beaten various schools throughout the state. We had played our own version of Pied Piper of Hamlin, wonderfully twisted by our extremely talent English Teacher. I also continued by intrest by directing various street plays to raise awareness of the environemtn about Nature as a part of my volunteer work in college.<br><br>
	Writing - Reporter of the Year, TTIS | Writing a Novel<br>I will be honest. I enjoy writing. It could be anything. I tend to get creative, powerful and reader-friendly. This allowed me to be a reputed member of TTIS and I got the opportunity to interview the likes of Baichung Bhutia and The Mumbai Dabbawallas. In addition to this, I am currently working on a novel. It is a fictional story based on the impact of growing up in a society that is centered around religious extremism.<br><br>
